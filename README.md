# FilterBlast-Backend

Welcome to FilterBlast-Backend! ðŸŽ¨ This repository powers the backend of FilterBlast, an innovative image filtering web application that allows users to upload images, apply trendy filters, and download the filtered images. Built with a modern tech stack, FilterBlast-Backend ensures a seamless, scalable, and efficient image processing experience using cloud storage, serverless technology, and an API-driven architecture.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

***Dynamic Image Upload and Filtering***: Users can upload images, which are then stored securely in Amazon S3. Our backend processes the images with popular filters like Hudson, Inkwell, Kelvin, and more, giving each photo a unique aesthetic transformation.

***Efficient AWS Integration***: All image files are stored in AWS S3, ensuring reliable and scalable storage. The backend handles uploading, downloading, and filter transformations with ease.

***Versatile Filter Options***: Our application leverages the Pilgram library to apply popular Instagram-style filters, allowing users to select from a range of visually appealing options.

***Real-Time Download Logging***: Each download is logged with user information, timestamp, and the specific filter applied. The logs are stored in MongoDB, giving insights into usage patterns and providing a record of user interactions.

***Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)***: Configured to allow secure communication with the React frontend, enabling seamless interactions from various client applications.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

***Flask***: Powers the API and application logic, managing routes for uploading, filtering, and downloading images.

***MongoDB Atlas***: Used for logging download activity, making it easy to store and retrieve data for analytics and user behavior insights.

***AWS S3***: Serves as our primary storage for original and filtered images, ensuring high availability and scalability.

***Pilgram Library***: Applies Instagram-like filters, giving users the ability to stylize images in various ways.

***Python Imaging Library (PIL/Pillow)***: Handles image processing tasks such as opening, transforming, and saving image files.

***Vercel***: Deploys the backend in a serverless, scalable environment with fast performance and low maintenance.

## ðŸ”¥ Key Endpoints
